conditions through Wednesday night. Temperatures and humidity will
increase with showers and storms back into the area for Thursday and
Friday.

High pressure remains over the Ohio Valley today. Fair weather and
warm temperatures continue. Forecast highs are in the middle to
upper 70s areawide under a mix of sun and clouds. And later that
night when his lights went out of sight came the wreck of the
Edmund Fitzgerald.

&&

.SHORT TERM /6 PM THIS EVENING THROUGH 6 PM THURSDAY/...
High pressure slowly drifts east of the Ohio Valley Wednesday night
through Thursday. Calm winds remain in place on Wednesday night
before southerly flow starts developing on Thursday. Highs reach up
near 80 on Thursday and moisture increases through the day.
Instability looks likely to develop by the afternoon which may allow
isolated showers and storms to form especially south of I-70. Gusty
winds and small hail are possible if a couple stronger storms form
during peak heating.

&&

.LONG TERM /THURSDAY NIGHT THROUGH TUESDAY/...
Southwest flow will be on the increase Thursday night into Friday
ahead of an approaching mid level short wave. An associated cold
front will then move east across the mid Ohio Valley Friday night
into Saturday morning. This will lead to an increasing chance of
showers and thunderstorms Friday into Friday night. Pcpn will taper
off from the west later Friday night into Saturday morning as the
front moves through. High on Friday will be in the mid 70s, cooling
to highs on Saturday in the mid to upper 60s.

Surface high pressure will build east across the Great Lakes
Saturday night through Sunday night. This will lead to mainly dry
conditions Sunday into Monday. A weak mid level short wave may
eventually bring a chance for some showers and thunderstorms by
Tuesday. As we get into return flow on the back side of the high, we
will see a warming trend through the first part of next week. Highs
on Sunday will be in the upper 60s to lower 70s, warming to highs by
Tuesday in the low to mid 80s.
