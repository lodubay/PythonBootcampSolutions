Group Challenge: Morse Code

Each member of your group has received a fragment of a transmission in Morse 
code. Buried somewhere within that transmission is a secret message that you
must report to your superiors as soon as possible. Each of you must write a
program which can decode a message written in Morse code, and run that program
on your message fragment. You may work together to develop your code, but each
team member must write their own program, and you may not share your message
fragments before you decode them. Good luck!

Details - Morse code is a character-encoding scheme that allows operators to
send messages using a series of electrical pulses represented as short or long
pulses, a.k.a. dots and dashes. It was invented by Samuel F. B. Morse.

Hint: We recommend starting by implementing the following mapping as a
dictionary.
